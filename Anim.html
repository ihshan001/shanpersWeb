            I have a rule in my life. <b>"Never judge a person by their look or what you hear, always make sure what you hear/see is the entire truth.Also knowing personally is better"</b>
            So you wouldn't know me entirely by just going through this website.

            If I tried something and didn't end the way I wanted, or didn't get what I deserve, I always say to myself-
            <b>"Whatever happened, their something good in it for me. If I can't see it now I will in future".</b>Either way, buckle up and get to know me, from what you read.
